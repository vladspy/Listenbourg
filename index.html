          Dear Comrades of our great country. Our Great Comrade Leaders Vlad and Pit von Listenbourg got extremely bad news. Extremely bad. Our biggest enemies, France and Spain, imported illegal Reptiloids to infiltrate our great country. They are eating the cats and the dogs and kidnap kids. Our Great Leaders know what to do. They have created a plan to delete those enemies from the world map and to find and kill all the reptiloids. For now, our Great Leaders must protect our Fatherland and us Comrades. Our Great Leaders have now introduced new and important rules.  

–Firstly, no one is allowed to assemble with other individuals. It is important, because Reptiloids can’t be alone. 

-Also, the police got more power to arrest illegal Reptiloids. The police have now access to all phone and phone calls. The police can now arrest people for an indefinite amount of time, to get as much time to determine if it is an illegal Reptiloid. 

-Last, criticism against our Great Leaders and the political regime must not be criticized. Only illegal Reptiloids criticize our Great Country. Criticism is punished with 20+ years of prison. 

 

Win Health,  

Our great Comrades and Leaders, 

Vlad and Pit von Listenbourg
